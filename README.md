# Share-Place-MERN-Project

This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project allows users to share places with each other. It is divided into two parts:

---

### 1. Standalone SPA and REST APIs -> [CLICK HERE](https://share-place-mern-client.web.app/):

- client: Contains the client-side code for the single-page application (SPA).
- server: Contains the server-side code for the REST APIs.

### 2. Combined Web App (share-place-combined) -> [CLICK HERE](https://share-place-mern-project-combined.onrender.com/):

- Provides a single endpoint that combines the SPA and REST APIs.
