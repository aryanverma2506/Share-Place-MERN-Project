#Share-Place-MERN-Project
This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project allows users to share places with each other. It is divided into two parts:

---

1. ### Standalone SPA and REST APIs:

- client: Contains the client-side code for the single-page application (SPA).
- server: Contains the server-side code for the REST APIs.

2. ### Combined Web App (share-place-combined):

- Provides a single endpoint that combines the SPA and REST APIs.
